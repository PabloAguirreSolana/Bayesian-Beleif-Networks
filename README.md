Using Bayesian Belief Networks to prove autocratic and democratic gobernment support in México using Latinobarómetro surveys (2018-2020)


This notebook aim is to provide the full code of a series of experiments that try to prove some hypothesis regarding the proness in mexican society to support an authoritarian regime vs a democractic one.

The data bases used for this experiment were taken from Latinobarómetro 2018 and 2020. The data frames used for this notebook, had been previously curated and treated to suit this experiements. (A notebook in this repository is provided to check what type of wrangling we did).

The models of this notebook, do not pretend to be exahustive of a Probabilistic Bayesian Network, they are a baseline by which different evidence can be tested, depending on the variables included in the model.

A notebook to wrangle and process the data to convert it to a friendly format for the models to run, is provided. Also the data sets from Latinobarómetro survey.
